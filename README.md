### Project Overview
 <p>
 To barter means to trade goods and services for other goods and services. The “Barter Bin” project that I am proposing will be a unique web application that allows its users to trade their goods and services with each other without the need of cash and other currency. With this project, I would like to introduce an alternative to traditional cash-based transactions. In this current economy not, everyone has the financial means to purchase certain things they may need, but everyone pretty much has something that they can offer no matter how big or small. Therefore, the exchanging of goods and services will help to create a sense of community, shared resources, and set a foundation of good will among it’s users. It will also help people to save money, reduce waste, and come in contact with people within their own communities (and nationwide).

 ### Goals and Objectives 
 <p>
The primary objective of the Barter Bin web application is to provide a user-friendly platform that connects individuals and businesses who are interested in trading goods and services with each other. To achieve this, the following goals have been created:

1. To build a strong, engaging, and diverse user community: I want to create a vibrate community of users who are passionate about bartering and are committed to building relationships with others in their local community.

2. Promote Sustainability and reduce waste: Barter Bin’s aim is to provide an alternative to acquiring new goods. By reducing the amount of waste generated by traditional cash transactions the web application can help users reduce their environmental footprint.

3. Provide a cost-effective solution for individuals and businesses: I have the belief that everyone has something to offer, and bartering can be an effective way to save money. By providing a platform for trading goods and services, Barter Bin can help potential users get the things they need with little to no money.

4. Help facilitate the growth of small businesses: Barter Bin can help small businesses to grow and thrive by leveraging the power of bartering. Small business owners can access the resources they need for “pennies on the dollar”.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
<p>
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Barter Bin web application is a simple, yet functional platform that will allow its users to post items and services for trade, while expressing their own needs, and matching individuals based on these indicators. Due to time constraints, some of the most important features to support the MVP would include:

1. User registration and Login: Potential users will be able to register an account and login to access the platform. 

2. Search and Match feature: Users will be able to express their needs and wants for the items and services they are interested in, and Barter Bin will comb through their database, which heavily utilizes MySQL in conjunction with PHP, and match them with potential trade partners on a 100% and 50% basis. Users will have the ability to search via city and state, and they can enable the “ignore location” on the search feature to broaden their range of matches. 

3. Messaging and Contact: Users will be able to contact and message potential trade partners via the “contact match” button feature of the web application. The messaging feature will allow users to communicate, negotiate the terms of the trade, and accept offers.

4. Notification system: Users should receive notifications once they have been matched or when the trade is completed with the full terms of the trade included.

5. Rating, review, and feedback system: THIS IS A STRETCH FEATURE -- After a trade is completed, users can rate and review their trade partner or just the overall Barter Bin process in the review section of the site. There should also be a way to provide feedback to include suggestions for improvement. 

With these features in place, the MVP for Barter Bin would be functional enough to allow people to express their needs and wants, be matched with potential trade partners, broaden their network via the search feature, contact potential trade partners, negotiate and finalize trades, and rate and review the process. As Barter Bin grows and evolves, additional features can be added to enhance user experience and provide more value to its users.
